# Numerical-Methods-Algorithms-Python
Numerical Methods Covered:  
--Root Finding: Bisection, Regula-Falsi, Secant, Newton–Raphson, Chebyshev.  
--Linear Systems: Jacobi, Gauss–Seidel, LU Decomposition, Gaussian Elimination.
--Interpolation: Newton's Divided Difference, Lagrange Interpolation. 
--Differential Equations: Euler’s Method, Heun’s Method, Runge–Kutta (including RK4).

These notebooks were created as part of a master's course in computational mathematics and data science to explore the computational implementation of various numerical methods. They provide a hands-on approach for understanding how algorithms perform on real mathematical problems.
